AI:  Based on your question and the context provided, it seems that you are looking for front-end and back-end framework options to build an e-commerce website for selling security cameras from China.

For the front-end, GraphQL API & React is a popular choice among developers due to its flexibility and ability to handle complex queries with ease. Additionally, GatsbyJS is another option that is known to be SEO-friendly and delivers extremely fast websites. Both frameworks are suitable for e-commerce websites.

For the back-end, Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a popular choice among developers due to its simplicity, scalability, and robustness. It's an MVC framework that provides a web service, default structures for a database, and web pages. Other options include Django, Laravel, ExpressJS, CakePHP, Flask, Asp .NET, Spring Boot, Koa, and Phoenix.

In terms of cost-effectiveness, RoR has a large and supportive community that can provide open-source solutions and plugins to help you achieve your desired functionality without breaking the bank. Additionally, using a cloud-based platform like Heroku for hosting and deployment can also save you from incurring additional costs associated with server maintenance and management.

It's important to note that each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
